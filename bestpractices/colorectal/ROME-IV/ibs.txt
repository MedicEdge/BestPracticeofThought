**Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) Diagnostic Criteria**:

A. Recurrent abdominal pain on average at least 1 day/week in the last 3 months, associated with two or more of the following criteria:
1. Related to defecation.
2. Associated with a change in frequency of stool.
3. Associated with a change in form (appearance) of stool.

*Symptom onset must be at least 6 months before diagnosis, and criteria must be met for the last 3 months.

**IBS Subtypes Based on Predominant Bowel Habits** (on days with at least one abnormal bowel movement):
- IBS with Constipation (IBS-C): Greater than 25% of bowel movements with Bristol stool types 1 or 2, and less than 25% with types 6 or 7.
- IBS with Diarrhea (IBS-D): Greater than 25% of bowel movements with Bristol stool types 6 or 7, and less than 25% with types 1 or 2.
- IBS with Mixed Bowel Habits (IBS-M): Greater than 25% of bowel movements with Bristol stool types 1 or 2, and greater than 25% with types 6 or 7.
- IBS Unclassified (IBS-U): Patients who meet diagnostic criteria for IBS but cannot be categorized into one of the above subtypes based on bowel habits.

*IBS subtypes should be assessed off medications used to treat bowel habit abnormalities. For clinical trials, a diary of at least 2 weeks is recommended to determine subtypes using the "25%-rule".
