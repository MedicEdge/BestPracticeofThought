Left-Sided Colonic Diverticulitis:
1. Initial evaluation should include history, physical exam, and laboratory tests (e.g., complete blood count, urinalysis, CRP, procalcitonin, fecal calprotectin).
2. Classic symptoms/signs include left lower quadrant pain, fever, and leukocytosis; other presentations like fecaluria or pneumaturia suggest colovesical fistula; stool per vagina suggests colovaginal fistula.
3. CT scan of the abdomen/pelvis is highly sensitive (95%) for diagnosis and to assess disease severity, assesses Hinchey classification, correlates with nonoperative management success, and identifies long-term complications.
4. Ultrasound can rule out other causes when diagnosis is unclear, but may miss complicated diverticulitis; effectiveness can be limited in certain patient populations (e.g., obesity).
5. MRI can differentiate neoplasia from diverticulitis and be used in patients where CT is contraindicated (e.g., pregnancy, contrast allergy).
