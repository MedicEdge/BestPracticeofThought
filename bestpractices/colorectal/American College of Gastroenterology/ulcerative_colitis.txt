Ulcerative Colitis (UC) Diagnostic Criteria and Prognosis:

Suspicion and Initial Consideration:
1. Hematochezia and urgency suggest UC
2. Exclude infectious etiologies at diagnosis

Diagnostic Procedures:
1. Colonoscopy with ileal intubation and biopsies from affected/unaffected areas for histological confirmation 
2. Disease extent classified as proctitis (E1), left-sided colitis (E2), extensive colitis (E3)

When Other Evaluations Are Not Required:
1. Normal terminal ileum on colonoscopy negates the need for further upper GI evaluation, unless suggestive of CD or other pathologies

Severity Assessment:
1. PRO based on bleeding and bowel habits, inflammatory burden, disease course and impact
2. Fecal calprotectin as a noninvasive marker of disease activity

Testing Recommendations:
1. Stool testing for C. difficile (strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence)
2. Against serologic antibody testing for UC diagnosis/prognosis (strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence)

Disease Monitoring and Management:
1. CRP, ESR as markers of systemic inflammation and disease severity
2. Consider clinical history, extraintestinal manifestations, smoking cessation, NSAID usage, enteric infections
3. FC as a discriminatory marker for differentiating IBD from irritable bowel syndrome 

Prognosis:
1. Assessing predictors of aggressive disease: extent, need for steroids, age at diagnosis, elevated CRP/ESR
2. Previous hospitalization increases risk of colectomy
3. Comprehensive assessment includes predictors of colectomy and response to therapy

Endoscopic and Histologic Findings:
1. Endoscopic severity with Mayo or UCEIS scores
2. Histologic features for defining extent and surveillance intervals

Impact on Quality of Life:
1. Consider psychosocial and economic disruption in disease assessment 

Evolution and Management of Disease:
1. Risk of disease extension in localized disease, importance of regular follow-up 

Factors Associated with Poor Prognosis:
1. Extensive colitis, systemic steroids need, younger age at diagnosis, elevated inflammatory markers, history of UC hospitalization
