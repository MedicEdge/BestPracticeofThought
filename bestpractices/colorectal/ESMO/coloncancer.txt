Localised Colon Cancer (according to ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines):

Risk Factors:
1. Incidence higher in males and varies between countries
2. Lifestyle changes ('Westernisation'), obesity, inactivity, alcohol, red meat, smoking may increase risk
3. Gut microbiota imbalances as potential risk factor
4. High risk for individuals with a history of adenoma, colon cancer, inflammatory bowel disease
5. Significant family history of CRC or adenoma
6. Hereditary cancer syndromes (e.g., familial adenomatous polyposis, Lynch syndrome)

Screening Recommendations:
1. Colonoscopy is recommended for CRC screening, with a repeat every 10 years if negative
2. Flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5-10 years supplemented with yearly FOBT if colonoscopy is refused
3. Non-invasive tests like FIT recommended if not enrolled in colonoscopy screening

Diagnosis:
1. Symptoms include changes in bowel habits, abdominal pain, weight loss, weakness, iron deficiency, anemia
2. Colonoscopy recommended for diagnosis unless urgent surgery is needed
3. CT scans of chest, abdomen, and pelvis to evaluate for distant metastases
4. Lab workups including complete blood count, coagulation profile, liver/kidney function tests, albumin, and CEA levels
5. MRI for clarifying ambiguous lesions or defining pT4b lesions
6. FDG-PET scan not routinely recommended for staging of localised CRC
