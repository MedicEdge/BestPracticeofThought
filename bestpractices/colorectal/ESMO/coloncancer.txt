Evaluation of Hemorrhoids:
1. Conduct a detailed medical history focused on duration and degree of symptoms such as bleeding, prolapse, perineal hygiene, and pain.
2. Identify risk factors such as constipation.
3. Evaluate for symptoms like bleeding with bowel movements and intermittent protrusion indicative of internal hemorrhoids.
4. Review fiber intake, bowel habits, and consistency and ease of defecation.
5. Perform physical examination, including digital rectal examination and anoscopic assessment.
6. Grade internal hemorrhoids based on their presentation and extent of prolapse.
- Strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C.

Evaluation of Rectal Bleeding:
1. Consider complete endoscopic evaluation of the colon in patients with symptomatic hemorrhoids and rectal bleeding.
2. Evaluate for colorectal cancer, IBD, diverticular disease, and other potential causes of bleeding.
- Strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B.
