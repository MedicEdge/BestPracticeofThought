Medical History: The patient has no significant medical history and has not undergone any major surgeries. She does not take any regular medications and has no known allergies.  Presenting Symptoms: 1. Abdominal Pain: The patient experiences intermittent lower abdominal pain that is often relieved after a bowel movement. 2. Bloating: The patient regularly complains of a feeling of fullness and tightness in her abdomen, particularly after consuming meals. 3. Altered Bowel Movements: The patient experiences irregular bowel movements, switching between periods of diarrhea and constipation. Stool consistency also varies, occasionally being loose and watery. 4. Excessive Gas: The patient experiences increased flatulence throughout the day, causing discomfort and embarrassment.  Patient History: - The patient reports that these symptoms have been occurring on and off for the past six months. - The abdominal pain tends to be mild to moderate, and occurs at different times of the day without any specific triggers. - Increased stress levels at work have been observed to coincide with more severe symptoms. - The patient has noticed that certain foods, especially those high in fat or processed, tend to worsen the bloating and discomfort. - No rectal bleeding, unintentional weight loss, or nocturnal symptoms are reported.  Physical Examination: - General appearance: The patient appears healthy and in no acute distress. - Vital signs: Normal blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature. - Abdomen: No signs of distension or tenderness. Bowel sounds are normoactive in all four quadrants.  Based on the patient's symptoms, medical history, and physical examination, there is a suspicion of a gastrointestinal disorder.

            "Processing with Blackbox: A 23-year-old university student presents with intermittent abdominal pain and irregular bowel habits for the past eight months. She reports experiencing both constipation and diarrhea, often linked to her exam periods and other stressors. The abdominal pain is typically crampy in nature and is partially relieved after a bowel movement. She denies any nocturnal symptoms, significant weight loss, or a family history of gastrointestinal disorders. The patient has tried stress reduction techniques and dietary adjustments, including increasing fiber intake, with limited success.\n",
            "Processing with Blackbox: A 67-year-old retired teacher, female, reports a persistent difficulty with bowel movements for over a year. She describes her bowel movements as infrequent, occurring roughly twice a week, and often accompanied by straining and a sensation of incomplete evacuation. The patient mentions that her stools are usually hard and dry. She has a history of hypothyroidism, which is currently managed with medication. She also mentions her sedentary lifestyle and a diet low in fruits and vegetables. The patient has occasionally used over-the-counter stool softeners, with variable relief.\n",
            "Processing with Blackbox: A 31-year-old software developer, male, comes in with complaints of frequent, sudden bowel movements without associated pain. He reports experiencing loose, watery stools up to four times a day for several months. The patient mentions these symptoms occur regardless of diet and are not accompanied by nocturnal symptoms, weight loss, or blood in the stool. He recalls no significant travel or dietary changes prior to the onset of symptoms. The patient has a high-stress job but no personal or family history of gastrointestinal disorders.\n",
            "Processing with Blackbox: A 40-year-old female, working as a graphic designer, presents with complaints of chronic abdominal bloating and a sensation of distension for over 6 months. She notes that these symptoms are more pronounced in the evenings and often fluctuate throughout the month. The patient denies significant alterations in her bowel habits, such as constipation or diarrhea, and reports no weight loss, vomiting, or blood in the stool. She has tried various over-the-counter anti-gas medications, with little to no relief. She follows a vegetarian diet and exercises regularly.\n"
