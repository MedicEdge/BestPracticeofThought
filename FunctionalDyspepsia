Functional Dyspepsia (FD) Diagnostic Criteria (ROME IV):

1. One or more of the following symptoms:
   - Bothersome postprandial fullness
   - Bothersome early satiation
   - Bothersome epigastric pain
   - Bothersome epigastric burning

AND

2. No evidence of structural disease (including at upper endoscopy) that is likely to explain the symptoms.

- The criteria must be fulfilled for the last 3 months with symptom onset at least 6 months prior to diagnosis.

Subtypes:

Postprandial Distress Syndrome (PDS): Diagnostic criteria:
- Bothersome postprandial fullness (impacting usual activities) and/or early satiation (preventing finishing a regular meal) at least 3 days a week.
- No evidence of organic, systemic, or metabolic disease to explain symptoms on routine investigations (including at upper endoscopy).
- Criteria fulfilled for the last 3 months with symptom onset at least 6 months before diagnosis.

Supportive criteria for PDS:
- Postprandial epigastric pain or burning, epigastric bloating, excessive belching, and nausea can be present.
- Vomiting suggests another disorder.
- Symptoms relieved by defecation should not be considered part of dyspepsia.
- Coexisting symptoms from GERD and IBS are possible.

Epigastric Pain Syndrome (EPS): Diagnostic criteria:
- Bothersome epigastric pain and/or burning (impacting usual activities) at least 1 day a week.
- No evidence of organic, systemic, or metabolic disease to explain the symptoms on routine investigations (including at upper endoscopy).
- Criteria fulfilled for the last 3 months with symptom onset at least 6 months before diagnosis.

Supportive criteria for EPS:
- Pain may be meal-induced, relieved by meal, or fasting.
- Epigastric bloating, belching, and nausea can be present.
- Persistent vomiting suggests another disorder.
- Pain does not fulfill criteria for biliary pain.
- Symptoms relieved by defecation should not be considered as part of dyspepsia.
- Coexisting symptoms from GERD and IBS are possible.
